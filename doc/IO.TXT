                                        11 to start a seek only.
$29     Read/Write      Current floppy sector; only low 5 bits matter.
                        Invalid sector for current media will cause an error
                        on seek.
$2A     Read/Write      Current floppy side and track. Highest bit is side,
                        while the low 7 bits are the track.
                        Invalid track for current media will cause an error

                        or read an error code if E is set to 1.
                        When writing, the sector is only written once all
                        512 bytes in that sector have been-

                                       remain the same, 0 if incremented
                                       after every byte (increments only
                                       16-bit; bank is not affected).
                                    f: 1 if the source address should remain
                                       the same, 0 if incremented after every

$49     Read/Write      DMA channel #0 source bank.
                                Note that DMA ignores bank 0 special memory map
                                and thus bank 0 is entirely ROM.

Monitor commands:

<bank>   = at most 2 hex digits for length
<number> = at most 4 hex digits for length
<addr>   = 4 hex digits for 16-bit address, or
           2 hex digits for bank ':' 4 hex digits for 16-bit address
<list>   = 2 hex digits for every byte, or ASCII with "..."
<range>  = <addr> <number=length>
